# Elements of Data Processing
This was the assignment for Elements of Data Processing Assignment 2. 
In it, we were to choose a topic and present a data analysis using the provided datasets.

In my case, I decided to investigate `“Does internet quality correlate with the risk of developing an illness?”`.
The results can be found in the [final report](finalreport.pdf).

Overally the subject was pretty interesting. I'm glad we were given so much freedom and it felt intellectually stimulating to come to your own conclusions.
